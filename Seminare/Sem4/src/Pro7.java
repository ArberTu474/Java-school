// Following Section 4.9, develop a program that reads a string and removes all dupliÂ­
// cates. For example, if the input is Mississippi, print Misp. Start small and just print the
// first letter. Then print the first letter and true if the letter is not duplicated elsewhere,
// false otherwise. (Look for it in the remaining string, by using the substring and
// indexOf methods.) Next, do the same for the first two letters, and print out for each
// letter whether or not they occur in the substring before and after the letter. Try with
// a string like oops. Extend to all characters in the string. Have a look at the output
// when the input is Mississippi. Which characters should you not report? At this time,
// you should have gathered enough experience that you can complete the program.
