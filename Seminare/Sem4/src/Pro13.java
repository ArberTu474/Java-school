// In the 17th century, the discipline of probability theory got its start when a gambler
// asked a mathematician friend to explain some observations about dice games. Why
// did he, on average, win a bet that at least one six would appear when rolling a die
// four times? And why did he seem to lose a similar bet, getting at least one double-six
// when rolling a pair of dice 24 times?
// Nowadays, it seems astounding that any person would roll a pair of dice 24 times in
// a row, and then repeat that many times over. Letâ€™s do that experiment on a computer
// instead. Simulate each game a million times and print out the wins and losses,
// assuming each bet was for $1.
